        <h1>Property Tracker</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A new and innovative way for young people to find their first home to buy</p>

        <p>During one semester at Umeå University, I got the opportunity to do a project with a startup in Umeå as a customer. Together with five other students, I worked on a project with the purpose to empower young people to buy their first property. During this project, we worked with a design-build-test method with the goal to develop the company’s main feature. At the end of the project, we delivered a new and innovative way for young people to find their first property to buy.</p>

        <h2>Project specifications</h2>
        <p>Starting off, we wrote a project plan together with a specification of requirements. This was done to make sure that we fulfilled the expectations of the customer, and met the University’s requirements and our own expectations of the project. Amongst other things, it included a meeting plan, timetable, milestones and tollgates, a quality plan, a risk analysis, and priorities. The specified requirements included everything from the requirements for the final prototype, the target group, and which documentation we will deliver, to how much time will be put into the project and the ways for communicating with the customer.</p>

        <h2>The design process</h2>
        <p>For this project, we worked agile with sprints of one week each. We worked in iterations where each iteration included a design, build and test phase. Starting off, we had planned for two iterations. In the end, the second one was changed into a shorter iteration, and a third iteration was added.</p>

        <h2>Iteration one</h2>
        <p>The first iteration started with a brainstorming session using sticky notes. The purpose of this session was to come up with problems that could make people hesitate from buying a property, and then find solutions to these problems. The problems (and their corresponding solutions) were grouped into piles and from this, we formed a couple of key sentences. </p>
        <p>To get a broad basis for the rest of the project, we did research and conducted a survey. For the research, we focused on the property market in general, the target group, and our customer’s current offer. The survey was conducted to gather information about people’s thoughts about buying their first property and how familiar they are with the process of buying a property. </p>
        <p>The next step was another brainstorming session where we used the key sentences to come up with a concept and lo-fi prototype. We used parallel prototyping where each project member came up with a concept and then presented this to the rest of the group with a simple prototype and pitch. We discussed each concept and then we split the group into two, creating one prototype each in Figma.</p>
        <p>A test of both prototypes was conducted on a total of 12 people, where the prototypes were presented to the test person in an altering order to get a more unbiased result.</p>

        <h2>Iteration two</h2>
        <p>After discussions with the customer concerning the result of the first iteration, it was decided to start over and brainstorm completely new and more out-of-the-box ideas. The reason for this was that the prototypes from the first iteration were similar to their existing offer and that the customer was hoping to get some more creative ideas out of this collaboration. This also led to the decision to add a third iteration and make the second one shorter.</p>
        <p>This short iteration started with an individual brainstorming session with the goal to come up with at least ten out-of-the-box ideas each. We categorized all 80 ideas and together with the customer, we decided to continue with six of the ideas. For each idea, we created one prototype which we tested on at least one person before a decision was made to move forward with one final idea.</p>

        <h2>Iteration three</h2>
        <p>To start the last iteration, we all did research concerning our final idea. Then, we created a simple user flow to show which screens to implement and how they should be connected. These screens were used for our final brainstorming session where we discussed the content and functionality of each screen. The final idea was gradually transformed into a prototype in Figma by starting with wireframes and then adding more and more design and functionality. The prototype was reviewed in a design evaluation by another project group and their feedback played a big part when we finalized and did the last adjustments to the prototype. If we had more time, we would have included further user tests. </p>

        <h2>Final prototype</h2>
        <p>Three iterations and plenty of ideas later, a prototype was finalized. The final prototype was an MVP where we had included the most important parts of the concept. Below is a selection of screens.</p>

        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <p>During the project, one of our highest-ranked risks actually happened. The customer made a u-turn regarding their business focus and got highly involved with another company. Within our risk analysis, we had described one plan for action if this happened. To pass the course and deliver a prototype at the end of the project, we continued according to previous requests. It was of course sad to see that the result was not taken further after the project but despite this, I was pleased with the result of the project and how the project group handled the situation.</p>
