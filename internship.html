        <h1>Discover nature</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Lowered thresholds to nature with the help of a mobile app</p>


        <p>In the summer of 2021, I had an internship at the Sundsvall municipality together with another student from another University. Our task was to investigate how we can design an experience that connects the physical with the digital to get more residents to discover the stunning nature around them. Our focus became on lowering the thresholds for those who do not already spend time in nature. With the help of an iterative approach and the design thinking method, we interviewed residents, created prototypes, and performed user tests.</p>
        
        <h2>Interviews with key roles</h2>
        <p>We started by interviewing important key roles who either worked at the municipality or were active in other relevant organizations. Going into the project, we were given a specific outdoor location in the municipality to focus on. During the interviews, important reflections quickly emerged, which primarily concerned the specific location we were focusing on, the socio-economic part, and the proximity to nature.</p>

        <h2>Redefining the problem description</h2>
        <p>The insights from the interviews made us question if we really should focus on a specific location in the multiplicity. With green lights from our employer, we rewrote the problem description. Instead of focusing on a specific location, we decided to focus on the nature close to each resident. We wanted lower the threshold to discovering nature by removing the need for transportation and reducing the need for planning. To achieve this, we aimed to create a curiosity about nature based on the residents’ location.</p>

        <h2>Target group and four personas</h2>
        <p>As already mentioned, we wanted to focus on those who do not already spend time in nature. To target these people, we used the insights from the interviews and created four personas. Together, these personas represented the residents that do not spend so much time in nature and the obstacles they face. To help us make decisions further on, we decided on one primary persona that was the most important for us to focus on. The primary persona was a family with a lot of kids and without access to a car. By using our personas in the continuous work, it became easier for us to remember who we are designing for and what they need.</p>

        <h2>From 70 ideas to four concepts</h2>
        <p>To start the ideation, we began to come up with ideas by having different mindsets to solve the problem, for example by thinking wrong, thinking childish, exclusive, and so on. This method comes from the book Fuck Logic by Per Robert Öhlin and the purpose of the method is to come up with a lot of ideas in a short period of time.</p>

        <div class="project__image">
            <img class="project__smallimg" src="images/Ideation1.PNG"/>
        </div>

        <p>At this point, we had around 50 different ideas on sticky notes. These ideas were grouped into six different piles together with ideas in the same category. To these piles, we added around 20 more ideas.</p>
        
        <div class="project__image">
            <img class="project__smallimg" src="images/Ideation2.PNG"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>From these ideas, we created three different concepts that we wanted to continue exploring. To present this idea within a limited time, we created a storyboard with a family where they used our concept in the form of a mobile application.</p>
        
        <p>After that, we used the MoSCoW method to prioritize everything we still thought was interesting. First, we took one persona at a time and prioritized the ideas based on their needs. What does the solution must have, should have, and what is nice to have? Following we did one final prioritization where we combined the outcome from the previous prioritization.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we decided on four different concepts to continue exploring, all of which could be implemented in the form of a mobile app.</p>

        <h2>Trying out ideas with residents</h2>
        <p>The concepts from the ideation were further investigated together with residents in the municipality. To explain the concepts, we used the images shown below. We went to a big mall and to a popular lake near the city center, where we discussed the concepts with visitors who also were given the opportunity to rank the concepts based on what they wanted themselves. Our insights from these discussions were that the different concepts appealed to different people and that many wanted a combination of two or more concepts. We went ahead with three of the concepts that we saw could be combined in a good way.</p>
        
        <div class="project__image">
            <img class="project__img" src="images/miun_concepts.jpg"/>
        </div>

        <h2>Iterative prototyping and testing</h2>
        <p>The final concept was realized in the form of a clickable prototype in Figma. We build on the prototype bit by bit where we did modifications based on feedback from user tests.</p>
        
        <p>By performing user tests of the prototype, we got the opportunity to see how users interact with the prototype and see where they may encounter problems. Even before there was a complete prototype of the application in place, the user tests started to allow users to influence and steer the design of the application in the right direction at an early stage.</p>
        
        <p>How the user tests were performed:</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>A clickable prototype was developed, which looks and behaves like a mobile app but with certain limitations.</li>
            <li>The test person was given access to the prototype. With the help of a test leader, the test person navigated around the prototype while using the "think aloud" method, which means that he shares all his thoughts during the test.</li>
            <li>During the test, the test leader asked questions to the test person with the aim to gain a better understanding of the test person's needs and behaviors.</li>
            <li>Based on the insights gained from the tests, the prototype was built and modified.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Final solution</h2>
        <p>The final prototype represents a mobile app whose main purpose is to lower the thresholds for getting out into nature by:</p>

        <ul type="1">
            <li>Helping the user with tips on what to do in nature based on the conditions.</li>
            <li>Helping the user orientate in nature with both map support and AR technology.</li>
            <li>Offering information about what the user may and may not do in nature.</li>
            <li>Working encouragingly by providing challenges and goals tailored to the user.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following are a couple of screens from the final prototype.</p>

        <div class="project__image">

        <div class="project__image">
            <img class="project__img" src="images/miun_result3.png"/>
        </div>

        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <p>The final solution was handed over to the municipality together with a demonstration of the prototype, and a presentation including suggestions for further development. After the end of the project, it was up to the municipality to use the results and lessons from the project to see if it is possible to realize the solution in its entirety, in parts, or woven into existing concepts.</p>
